For instance, probability of getting (H)eads in a coin toss is \\(1/2\\). Deterministic models will give the same results given the same inputs (e.g. 2 times 2 is 4), but probabilistic models might yield different outcomes. An experiment is a process that generates data. For instance, tossing a coin is an experiment. Outcome is the realization of an experiment. Possible outcomes for a coin toss is Heads and Tails. Sample space (\\(\\mathbb{S}\\)) is the collection of all the possible outcomes of an experiment. Sample space of the coin toss is \\(\\mathbb{S} = \\{H,T\\}\\). Sample space of two coin tosses experiment is \\(\\mathbb{S} = \\{HH,HT,TH,TT\\}\\). Sample space can be discrete (i.e. coin tosses) as well as continuous (i.e. All real numbers between 1 and 3. \\(\\mathbb{S} = \\{x | 1 \\le x \\le 3, x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}\\)) (Side note: Sample space is not always well defined.) An event is a subset of sample space. While outcome represents a realization, event is an information. Probability of an event \\(P(A)\\), say getting two Heads in two coin tosses is \\(P(A) = 1/4\\). A random variable represents an event is dependent on a probabilistic process. On the other hand, a deterministic variable is either a constant or a decision variable. For instance, value of the dollar tomorrow can be considered a random variable but the amount I will invest is a decision variable (subject to no probabilistic process) and spot (current) price of the dollar is a constant. 1.1 Set Operations Complement of an event (\\(A^\\prime\\)) with respect to the sample space represents all elements of the sample space that are not included by the event (A). For instance, complement of event \\(A=\\{HH\\}\\) is \\(A^\\prime=\\{HT,TH,TT\\}\\) Union of two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) (\\(A \\cup B\\)) is a set of events which contains all elements of the respective events. For example, say \\(A\\) is the set that contains events which double Heads occur (\\(A = \\{HH,HT,TH\\}\\)) and \\(B\\) is the set which Tails occur at least once (\\(B = \\{TT,HT,TH\\}\\)). The union is \\(A \\cup B = \\{HH,TH,HT,TT\\}\\). Intersection of two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) (\\(A \\cap B\\)) contains the common elements of the events. For example, say \\(A\\) is the set that contains events which Heads occur at least once (\\(A = \\{HH,HT,TH\\}\\)) and \\(B\\) is the set which Tails occur at least once (\\(B = \\{TT,HT,TH\\}\\)). The intersection is \\(A \\cap B = \\{TH,HT\\}\\). Mutually exclusive or disjoint events mean that two events have empty intersection (\\(A \\cap B = \\emptyset\\)) and their union (\\(A \\cup B\\)) contains the same amount of elements as the sum of their respective number of elements. Also \\(P(A \\cap B) = 0\\) and \\(P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)\\). For example getting double Heads (\\(HH\\)) and double Tails (\\(TT\\)) are mutually exclusive events. 1.2 Axioms of Probability Any event \\(A\\) belonging to the sample space \\(A \\in \\mathbb{S}\\) should have nonnegative probability (\\(P(A) \\ge 0\\)). Probability of the sample space is one (\\(P(\\mathbb{S}) = 1\\)). Any disjoint events (\\(A_i \\cap A_j = \\emptyset \\ \\forall_{i,j \\in 1 \\dots n}\\)) satisfies \\(P(A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup A_n) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + \\dots + P(A_n)\\). 1.3 Other Set and Probability Rules \\((A^\\prime)^\\prime = A\\) \\(S^\\prime = \\emptyset\\) \\(\\emptyset^\\prime = S\\) \\((A \\cap B)^\\prime = A^\\prime \\cup B^\\prime\\) \\((A \\cup B)^\\prime = A^\\prime \\cap B^\\prime\\) \\((A \\cup B) \\cap C = (A \\cap C) \\cup (B \\cap C)\\) \\((A \\cap B) \\cup C = (A \\cup C) \\cap (B \\cup C)\\) \\((A \\cup B) \\cup C = A \\cup (C \\cup B)\\) \\((A \\cap B) \\cap C = A \\cap (C \\cap B)\\) \\(A \\cup A^\\prime = \\mathbb{S}\\) and \\(A \\cap A^\\prime = \\emptyset\\) so \\(P(A) = 1 - P(A^\\prime)\\). This is especially useful for many problems. For example the probability of getting at least one Heads in a three coin tosses in a row is \\(1 - P(\\{TTT\\}) = 7/8\\), the complement of no Heads in a three coin tosses in a row. Otherwise, you should calculate the following expression. \\[P(\\{HTT\\}) + P(\\{THT\\}) + P(\\{TTH\\}) + P(\\{HHT\\}) + P(\\{HTH\\}) + P(\\{THH\\}) + P(\\{HHH\\}) = 7/8 \\] If \\(A \\subseteq B\\) then \\(P(A) \\le P(B)\\). \\(P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)\\). \\(P(A \\cup B \\cup C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A \\cap B) - P(B \\cap C) - P(A \\cap C) + P(A \\cap B \\cap C)\\) 1.4 Counting Counting rules will help us enumerate the sample space. It will include multiplication rule, permutation and combination. 1.4.1 Multiplication Rule If I have a series of independent events, say \\(1\\) to \\(k\\), and number of possible outcomes are denoted with \\(n_1\\) to \\(n_k\\); total number of outcomes in the sample space would be \\(n_1n_2\\dots n_k\\). Take a series of coin tosses in a row. If I toss a coin its sample space consists of 2 elements such as \\(\\{H,T\\}\\). If I toss 2 coins the sample space would be 2*2 \\(\\{HH,HT,TH,TT\\}\\). If I toss 3 coins, the sample space would be 2*2*2 \\(\\{HHH,HTH,THH,TTH,HHT,HTT,THT,TTT\\}\\). A poker card consists of a type and a rank. There are four types of playing cards (clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades) and 13 ranks (A - 2 to 10 - J - Q - K). Number of cards in a deck is 4*13 = 52. 1.4.2 Permutation Rule Permutation is the arrangement of all or a subset of items. Given a set of items, say \\(A = {a,b,c}\\) in how many different ways I can order the elements? Answer is n!. In our case it is, \\(3! = 3.2.1 = 6\\). \\[A = \\{a,b,c\\},\\{b,a,c\\},\\{b,c,a\\},\\{c,a,b\\},\\{c,b,a\\},\\{a,c,b\\}\\] Suppose there are 10 (n) participants in a competition and 3 (r) medals (gold, silver and bronze). How many possible outcomes are there? Answer is \\(n(n-1)(n-2)\\dots (n-r+1) = \\dfrac{n!}{(n-r)!} = \\dfrac{10!}{(10-3)!} = 720\\). If there are more than one same type items in a sample, then the permutation becomes \\(\\dfrac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\\dots n_k!}\\) where \\(\\sum n_i = n\\). For example enumerate the different outcomes of four coin tosses which result in 2 heads and 2 tails. Answer is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\) \\[A = \\{HHTT,HTTH,HTHT,THTH,THHT,TTHH\\}\\] 1.4.3 Combination Rule Suppose we want to select \\(r\\) items from \\(n\\) items and the order does not matter. So the number of different outcomes can be found using \\(\\binom{n}{r} = \\dfrac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}\\). Out of 10 students how many different groups of 2 students can we generate? Answer \\(\\dfrac{10!}{8!2!} = 45\\) 1.5 Chapter Problems Suppose I toss a coin, roll a die and draw a card from the deck. How many different number of outcomes are there for this experiment? Solution: Multiplication rule. \\(n_1n_2n_3 = 2.6.52 = 624\\). n1 &lt;- 2 #A coin toss has two potential outcomes. n2 &lt;- 6 #A die roll has six potential outcomes. n3 &lt;- 52 #A card draw has 52 potential outcomes. In how many ways can I order the Teletubbies? (Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po) For instance, (TW - Dipsy - Po - Laa Laa) is an ordering and (Dipsy - Po - TW - Laa Laa) is another. Solution: Permutation rule. \\(n! = 4! = 24\\) n_tubbies &lt;- 4 #Number of teletubbies factorial(n_tubbies) #By permtuation it is 4! ## [1] 24 I want to reorder the letters of the phrase “GOODGRADES”. In how many ways can I do it?. Solution: Remember the permutation rule with identical items. There are two “G”s, two “D”s and two “O”s. Remember the formula \\(\\dfrac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\\dots n_k!}\\). So the result should be \\(\\dfrac{10!}{2!2!2!1!1!1!1!} = 453600\\). the_phrase &lt;- &quot;GOODGRADES&quot; freq_table &lt;- table(strsplit(the_phrase, split = &quot;&quot;)[[1]]) #Let&#39;s create a frequency table first print(freq_table) #Let&#39;s show it ## ## A D E G O R S ## 1 2 1 2 2 1 1 the_dividend &lt;- factorial(nchar(the_phrase)) #Dividend part is 10 characters so 10! the_divisor &lt;- prod(factorial(freq_table)) #Get multiplication of factorials for the divisor the_dividend/the_divisor ## [1] 453600 I want to make two letter words from “GRADES” such as “GA”, “ED” or “DE” (it doesn’t have to make sense). Find the number of permutations. Solution: Permutation of \\(r\\) items from \\(n\\) items is \\(\\dfrac{n!}{(n-r)!}\\). So the result is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{4!} = 30\\). the_phrase&lt;-&quot;GRADES&quot; letter_length &lt;- 2 #We want two letter words #Since all letters are different no need for special permutation. factorial(nchar(the_phrase))/factorial(nchar(the_phrase)-letter_length) ## [1] 30 Suppose I am drawing a hand of 5 cards from a playing deck of 52 cards. How many different hands there can be? (Each card is different. See the bottom of this document for details.) Solution: Since in a hand you do not care for the order, it is the combination \\(\\binom{52}{5} = \\dfrac{52!}{(52-5)!5!} = 2598960\\). #Combination (a.k.a binomial coefficient) function is choose choose(52,5) ## [1] 2598960 1.6 Extra Problems Question 1 Suppose we draw three cards from a deck and roll two dice.

["cond.html", "Chapter 2 Conditional Probability and Bayes’ Rule 2.1 Some Examples 2.2 Conditional Probability 2.3 Independence 2.4 Product rule 2.5 Bayes’ Rule", " Chapter 2 Conditional Probability and Bayes’ Rule Let’s recall some probability concepts. Probability is the quantification of uncertainty. For instance in a coin toss, \\(P(H) = 1/2\\). Set of the union of all possible events is the sample space. For instance single coin toss sample space is \\(S = \\{H,T\\}\\). Probability of an event is actually the relative “size” of the event to the sample space. In an experiment, that has equally likely outcomes, number of potential outcomes in an event relative to the total number of outcomes in the sample space corresponds to the probability of that event. Some events are mutually exclusive and some events are dependent. Sample space is not always easy to measure and is not always finite. Counting is one way of estimating a sample space (especially discrete ones). Estimation of probability of events is not always easy. One way to estimate is to repeat the experiment for a number of times. As we increase the number of repetitions, the probability will become more stable. For instance suppose we don’t know the probability of getting (H)eads in a coin toss and we repeat coin tossing for a number of times. set.seed(231) coin_toss_probability&lt;-function(repetitions){ experiment&lt;-sample(c(&quot;H&quot;,&quot;T&quot;),size=repetitions,replace=TRUE) return(round(sum(experiment==&quot;H&quot;)/repetitions,4)) } #Do the experiment with increasing repetitions coin_toss_probability(repetitions=10) ## [1] 0.6 coin_toss_probability(repetitions=100) ## [1] 0.57 coin_toss_probability(repetitions=1000) ## [1] 0.505 coin_toss_probability(repetitions=50000) ## [1] 0.4989 2.1 Some Examples In a sports bar, there are 10 football fans, 15 basketball fans, 12 tennis fans and 6 curling fans. Suppose there is a single TV and there are matches of football, basketball, tennis and curling at the same time. If the TV remote is handed to one of them randomly, what is the probability that curling will be the show on TV? Answer: There are a total of 43 fans in the sports bar and 6 curling fans. P(Curling) = 6/43. Suppose there is a group of 20 people; 10 from Ankara, 10 from Istanbul. Suppose we randomly choose 5 people from that group. What is the probability that all of this subgroup is from Ankara? Answer: (# of combinations including people only from Ankara) / (# of total combinations) \\[\\dfrac{\\binom{10}{5}}{\\binom{20}{5}} = 0.01625387\\] Alternative answer is: \\((10/20)*(9/19)\\dots * (6/16) = 0.01625387\\). What is the probability that at least two from Ankara and at least two from Istanbul? Answer: P(Ankara = 2, Istanbul = 3 OR Ankara = 3, Istanbul = 2) = (P(Ankara = 2, Istanbul = 3) + P(Ankara = 3, Istanbul = 2)) = ((# of comb. Ank 2, Ist 3) + (# of comb. Ank 3, Ist 2))/(# of total combinations) \\[\\dfrac{\\binom{10}{2}*\\binom{10}{3} + \\binom{10}{3}*\\binom{10}{2}}{\\binom{20}{5}} = 0.6965944\\] (“Blackjack”) Suppose you are drawing two cards from the deck. Assume all number rank cards (2-10) are points, Ace (A) is 11 points and (J)ack, (Q)ueen and (K)ing are 10 points. What is the probability that total points of these two cards exceed 20. Answer: Max score for two cards is 22 (two Aces). To exceed 20, one needs Ace-9 pairs or any pair of 10-Ace-J-Q-K cards. We know that there are 4 of each rank. So \\(P(Score \\ge 20) = P(A and 9) + P(any\\ two\\ of\\ 10-Ace-J-Q-K)\\). We know that total number of hands is \\(\\binom{52}{2} = 1326\\). So # of combinations with either A-9 or 9-A is \\(4*4 = 16\\). # of combinations of getting two cards from 10-Ace-J-Q-K ranks is \\(\\binom{20}{2} = 190\\). So \\(P(Score \\ge 20) = \\dfrac{190 + 16}{1326} = 0.1553544\\) Alternative answer: \\(P(A-9 or 9-A) = 4/52*4/51 + 4/52*4/51 = 0.01206637\\) and \\(P(any two of 10-Ace-J-Q-K) = 20/52 * 19/51 = 0.1432881\\). Total probability is \\(P(Score \\ge 20) = 0.01206637 + 0.1432881 = 0.1553545\\) Suppose you are the gatekeeper of a playing ground for 10 year old boys and try to assess their age by their height. Height of 90% of boys aged 10 falls between 130 and 150 cms. It is equally likely that a boy aged 10 has the height lower than 130 cm or higher than 150 cm. What is the probability of rejecting a child because he’s too long? Answer: \\(P(130 \\le X \\le 150) = 0.9\\) and \\(P(X \\le 130) = P(X \\ge 150)\\). So \\(P(X \\ge 150) = 1 - P(130 \\le X \\le 150) - P(X \\le 130)\\). \\(2.P(X \\ge 150) = 0.1\\) and \\(P(X \\ge 150) = 0.05\\). 2.2 Conditional Probability Definition: \\(P(A|B)\\) means that probability of event A given that event B already occured or probability of A conditional on B. Example: What is the probability of getting two heads (HH) if we know that the first coin is H? (1/2) Example: Suppose we are rolling two dice. What is the probability of getting the sum equal to 8? \\(P(Sum = 8) = P(D_1 = 2, D_2 = 6) + P({3,5}) + P({4,4})*2 + P({5,3}) + P({6,2}) = 6/36 = 1/6\\) What is the probability of getting the sum more than or equal to 8 given the first roll is 3? \\(P(Sum \\ge 8 | D_1 = 3) = P({3,5}) + P({3,6}) = 2/6 = 1/3\\) Conditional probability of event A given B, can be defined as \\(P(A|B)=\\dfrac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\\) if \\(P(B) &gt; 0\\). Example: We asked 1000 people, 400 men and 600 women: ‘Where do you want to visit this summer? Amsterdam or London?’. The answers are as follows. ## Amsterdam London ## Men 150 250 ## Women 450 150 What is the probability of a randomly chosen person is a woman? Answer: \\(P(W) = (n(W|L) + n(W|P))/n(S) = (150 + 450)/1000 = 0.6\\) What is the probability of a randomly chosen person chooses to to visit Amsterdam? Answer: \\(P(A) = (n(A|W) + n(A|M))/n(S) = (450 + 150)/1000 = 0.6\\) What is the probability of a London visitor is a man? Answer: \\(P(M|L) = \\dfrac{P(M\\cap L)}{P(L)} = \\dfrac{n(M\\cap L)/n(S)}{n(L)/n(S)} = 250/400 = 0.625\\) 2.3 Independence Two events can be independent. It means \\(P(A|B) = P(A)\\) or \\(P(B|A) = P(B)\\). If the events (\\(A_i\\)) are independent then \\(P(A_1 \\cap A_2 \\dots A_k) = P(A_1)P(A_2)\\dots P(A_k)\\). Example: Suppose you rolled a die 5 times and they all ended up 4. What is the probability that, at the 6th time, the die will get 4 again? Solution: Die rolls are independent events. So outcome of a roll does not affect the outcome of the other rolls. It is 1/6. 2.4 Product rule If both \\(P(A)&gt;0\\) and \\(P(B)&gt;0\\), then \\(P(A\\cap B) = P(A)P(B|A)\\). We can also say \\(P(A\\cap B) = P(B\\cap A) = P(B)P(A|B)\\) Example: You draw two cards from a deck. What is the probability that you get two (A)ces? Solution: \\(P(A \\cap B) = 4/52 * 3/52 = 0.00443787\\) Example: You are at a tea shop. There are 10 (W)hite teas, 12 (B)lack teas and 8 (G)reen teas on the menu. According to the waiter all teas are equally tasty. You ask the waiter bring a tea but it should not be green tea. What is the probability that you will get a white tea? Solution: \\(P(W|G^{\\prime}) = P(W \\cap G^{\\prime})/P(G^{\\prime}) = P(W) / P(G^{\\prime}) = \\dfrac{10/30}{22/30} = 10/22\\) 2.5 Bayes’ Rule Theorem of total probability: Given the events \\(B_i\\) are collective parts of the sample space and \\(P(B_i) &gt; 0\\), then for any event \\(A\\), \\(P(A) &gt; 0\\) \\[P(A) = \\sum_i^k P(B_i \\cap A) = \\sum_i^k P(B_i)P(A|B_i)\\] Bayes’rule: Given the events \\(B_i\\) are collective parts of the sample space and \\(P(B_i) &gt; 0\\), then for any event \\(A\\), \\(P(A) &gt; 0\\) \\[P(B_r|A) = \\dfrac{P(B_r|A)}{\\sum_i^k P(B_i \\cap A)} = \\dfrac{P(B_r)P(A|B_r)}{\\sum_i^k P(B_i)P(A|B_i)}\\] Example 2.41 from the book: In an assembly plant, there are three machines \\(B_1\\), \\(B_2\\) and \\(B_3\\). These machines make the 30%, 45% and 25% of the products. 2%, 3% and 2% of their output is known to be defective. So, what is the probability of getting a defective product at a random time? Solution: Say, event of getting a defective item is A and we want to know \\(P(A)\\). \\(P(B_i)\\) is the probability of a product being manufactured by machine \\(i\\). \\(P(B_1) = 0.3\\), \\(P(B_2) = 0.45\\), \\(P(B_3) = 0.25\\). The defect probabilities given the machine are \\(P(A|B_1) = 0.02\\), \\(P(A|B_1) = 0.03\\), \\(P(A|B_1) = 0.02\\). So, \\(P(A) = \\sum_{i=1}^3 P(B_i)P(A|B_i) = 0.3*0.02 + 0.45*0.03 + 0.25*0.02 = 0.0245\\). Example 2.42: If the product is defective, what is the probability that it came from machine 3? \\[P(B_3|A) = \\dfrac{P(B_3 \\cap A)}{\\sum_{i=1}^3 P(B_i)P(A|B_i)} = \\dfrac{P(B_3)P(A|B_3)}{\\sum_{i=1}^3 P(B_i)P(A|B_i)} = \\dfrac{0.25 * 0.02}{0.0245} = 10/49\\] "],
