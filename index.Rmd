# Introduction {-}

This book is the combined lecture notes of my course IE-231 Introduction to Probability at Istanbul Bilgi University, Turkey. As the name suggests, these notes consist of an abbreviated version of the course as the objective is to give the essence of very significant parts of Probability. The course mainly follows [@myers2012].

This book is periodically updated. Latest update is on `r Sys.Date()`.
